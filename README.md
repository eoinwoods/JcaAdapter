# Legacy J2EE JCA Adapter Example

This repository contains a working example of a J2EE JCA (Java Connectivity Architecture) adapter to show how to write these quite obscure components.

The code was created with WebLogic 10.0 in about 2008.  It uses Apache Ant as its build tool.  To build successfully, the code needs the J2EE API definitions, which in this case are referenced via $WEBLOGIC_HOME/lib/api.jar.

        To allow the adapter to be used outside its containing EAR then

        The following setting is needed if you want the adapter's classes
        to be visible outside the EAR.  If you use any types which are
        defined within the adapter as parameter types in the connection
        factory then you need to set this to "true" otherwise deployment
        fails.  This is probably a WLS fault, but it's easy enough to
        live with.

         bind the connection factory instance to, that allows applications to
         find the adapter and get a connection to it.
